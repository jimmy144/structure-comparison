------
setup for structure homolog search
------
Enclosed in this package please find the script to download protein database from Protein Data Bank. Please do not delete or change this file.

Note: If you just want to do pairwise or multiple structure alignment, you do not 
have to download these databases, which are supposed to be used for only structure homolog search.
You can also build your own database for structure homology search.


-------------
main programs
-------------
1. Pairwise structure alignment
User choose one input file.pdb and one input known protein file.pdb

2. Database search
To run database search: use choose one input file and one input known protein folder


--------
examples for programs
--------
The result folder contain some test results
